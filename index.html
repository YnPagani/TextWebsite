<h1>Song that reflect the modern age</h1>
<h2>We're Only Gonna Die</h2>

<p>Early man walked away as modern man took control<br>
Their minds weren't quite the same, to <strong>conquer</strong> was his goal<br>
So he built his <strong>great empire</strong> and he <strong>slaughtered</strong> his own kind<br>
Then he died a <strong>confused man</strong>, <strong>killed himself</strong> with his own mind<br>
We're gonna die<br>
From our own <strong>arrogance</strong></p><br>
